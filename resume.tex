I have been building a homelab for a few years now. The lab includes used enterprise server and networking equipment. This homelab is dual use it is partially "production" and "development". The production side includes the NAS, media server, network wide ad-blocking, and a few other "critical" services that my family relies on. The "development" side is where I am able to do testing with new technologies without fear of losing production uptime.
