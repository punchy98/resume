\addsec{Personal Project - Homelab}
I have been building a homelab for a few years now. The lab includes used enterprise server and networking equipment. This homelab is dual use it is partially "production" and "development". The production side includes the NAS, media server, network wide ad-blocking, and a few other "critical" services that my family in multiple states rely on. The "development" side is where I am able to do testing with new technologies without fear of losing production uptime. I also have dozens of IoT devices deployed, everything from power monitoring to smart bulbs to cameras - all managed via Home Assistant.
